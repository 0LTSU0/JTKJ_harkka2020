Final project for course "Introduction to computer systems / Tietokonejärjestelmät"

This is a program for SimpleLink CC2650 SensorTag which turns the device into controller for a simple Tron game. By rotating the device it'll send commands wirelessly to the server of the game but even without access to the game itself, you can test the functionality of this because the program also shows everything relevant on the screen.
